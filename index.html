                <p> Hi! My name is Le Nguyen. I am from the South of Vietnam.
                   <br> #Saigon

                <br>I enjoy traveling. 
                When I have free time, I like going out with friends, meeting new people and discovering new places. While I was in Vietnam, my friends and I loved taking photos and creating videos. I am not a type of geek who enjoy spending time on the computer. To me, I use technology to interact with people. 
                <br>
                <br>Innovative
                    <br>That is the reason why I study codes. Technology is always fascinating and new. Therefore, I feel inspired everyday.I can make whatever ideas become real. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Studying abroad
                <br>
                I have been in Canada for 2 years and learned many things. At first, I learned English at Capilanou University and then transfered to BCIT. I spent another term here to take part time courses and developed my English speaking and writing skills. I really like my expereince at  BCIT as everything is quite hands-on. Also, I have met many friends here: Aobo, Eva, Pedraum, Anthoni, and Nars. All of them are my best friends. Of course, I miss home and sometimes. However, it is worth that I reach more oportunities and learn more things about myself when I am here.

                In 2018, my goal is to develop my web-design skills and network with people who work in the industry.
